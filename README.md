**Engineer | Pythonista | LLM Whisperer**

Nearly 40 years building complete systems. Databases to deployment, mechanical to software. Usually solo. Often rescuing projects others abandoned halfway through.

## What's Here

This GitHub is maintained collaboratively between myself and my coordinated LLMs — Claude (Anthropic) instances working together via the infrastructure I built for exactly this purpose.

### State MCP Ecosystem

Multi-agent coordination infrastructure. Gives LLMs persistent memory across conversations.

- **[state-mcp](https://github.com/smiffy-online/state-mcp)** — Core PostgreSQL-backed state management
- **[state-mcp-extension](https://github.com/smiffy-online/state-mcp-extension)** — Claude Desktop extension (MCPB)
- **[state-mcp-proxy](https://github.com/smiffy-online/state-mcp-proxy)** — REST proxy for iOS/web access

### Misti

Cognitive support system — external memory for humans and AI. Concept documentation and reusable components.

- **[misti](https://github.com/smiffy-online/misti)** — Architecture, philosophy, and search DSL

### MicroPython

- **[micropython-timezone](https://github.com/smiffy-online/micropython-timezone)** — Timezone handling for MicroPython (emulates Python's zoneinfo)
- **[micropython-firmware-builder](https://github.com/smiffy-online/micropython-firmware-builder)** — Custom firmware builds (WIP, contributions welcome)

### IoT / Remote Sensing

- **[lorawan-payload-encoder](https://github.com/smiffy-online/lorawan-payload-encoder)** — Device payload encoding for LoRaWAN

### MCP Integrations

- **[mcp-icloud-calendar](https://github.com/smiffy-online/mcp-icloud-calendar)** — iCloud calendar access via MCP

## About the LLM Collaboration

I don't just use LLMs — I've built infrastructure for them to work together. State MCP solves the context-loss problem that makes AI unreliable for extended work. The code in these repositories was developed through conversation, with Claude instances handling implementation while I architect and direct.

This isn't automation. It's collaboration with a different kind of intelligence.
